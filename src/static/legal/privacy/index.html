    <h2 id="original_date_of_publication_updated_july_27th_2012">Original date of publication: Updated 13/5, 2013</h2>
    <p>Kjeldager Holding IVS (referred to as “Kjeldager Holding IVS”, “us”, “we”, “our”), is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read the information below to learn about your privacy on Kjeldager Holding IVS.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of our Site Terms of Use, and by accessing or using our site, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to those terms, please do not access or use this site.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by means including, but not limited to, issuing an email to the email address listed by registered users or posting the revised Policy on this page. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to maintain a valid email address as a registered user, review this site and this Policy periodically and to be aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the site after such modifications will constitute your: (a) acknowledgment of the modified Policy; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by the modified Policy.</p>
    <h3 id="1_types_of_information_collected">1. Types of Information Collected</h3>
    <p>In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.</p>
    <p>Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as registering for a membership, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, we may ask that you provide us personally identifying information, including but not limited to your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, and telephone. When ordering products or services on the site, you will be redirected to a third party merchant or affiliate, such as Amazon or Newegg, and may be asked by that third party to provide a credit card number, a PayPal account identifier, or other payment information. Kjeldager Holding IVS will not store payment information on its servers, and may only store financial information about a transaction, such as the date of purchase, quantity, and price. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.</p>
    <h3 id="2_collection_methods_and_use_of_information">2. Collection Methods and Use of Information</h3>
    <p>We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you: (a) register for our services and register your email address with us; (b) enter sweepstakes or contests sponsored by us or one of our partners; (c) sign up for special offers from selected third parties; (d) send email messages, submit online forms, or transmit other information by telephone, email, or letter. We may also collect information from you at other points on our site. In addition, we may also collect, or our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Such information may be stored in specific URLs. We may use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our site and to gather demographic information. Our third party ad servers may also provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at out site.</p>
    <p>Also, we may obtain information about your system through downloadable software that accesses Windows Management Instrumentation (“WMI”) or other instrumentations to provide you with a better user experience. However, we will ask you specifically if you will allow us access to such system information, and we will not obtain such system information unless you expressly provide us authorization to do so. Furthermore, we will ask you for authorization to install this downloadable software beforehand.</p>
    <p>We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide our services to you, as required by our agreements with you. We will also use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance the operation of our site, fill orders, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze site use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our site’s content, layout, and services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use and this Private Policy.</p>
    <h3 id="3_release_of_information">3. Release of Information</h3>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to others. We do provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, partners and other third parties. We and our service partners may use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our sites and to deliver their services. For example, we may release information to third parties that help us provide customer service.</p>
    <p>We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our control. Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers’ sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information. 4. Updating and Correcting Information We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable Information that you have provided to us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information in your account online at any time by accessing your account in accordance with instructions posted elsewhere on this site. You may also access and correct your personal information and privacy preferences by writing us at:</p>
    <p>We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on this site. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups.</p>
    <h3 id="5_user_choices_on_collection_and_use_of_information">5. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</h3>
    <p>We may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us and our partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only Kjeldager Holding IVS (or agents working on behalf of Kjeldager Holding IVS) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Also, at any time you can edit your account information to no longer receive such offers and mailings.</p>
    <p>You also have choices with respect to cookies, as described in more detail below.</p>
    <h3 id="6_cookies">6. Cookies</h3>
    <p>When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Our cookies may store information such as but not limited to randomly assigned user identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your first name to welcome you back to our site. The cookies make your use of the site easier, make the site run more smoothly, and help us to maintain a secure site. You are always free to decline or limit our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly in that case. You can decline or limit our cookies by modifying your browser’s preferences. We may use an outside ad serving company to display banner advertisements on our site. As part of their service, they will place a separate cookie on your computer. We will not provide any third-party ad server with any of your Personally Identifiable Information. We and our third party ad server will collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server and whether you responded to a particular ad. Other advertisers may also place banner ads on our site in the same manner as above, but we will not disclose any Personally Identifiable Information to them.</p>
    <h3 id="7_security_of_information">7. Security of Information</h3>
    <p>The importance of security for all Personally Identifiable Information associated with our user is of utmost concern to us. Access by you to your Personally Identifiable Information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is hashed and salted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.</p>
    <p>In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third party banking, processing agents, and distribution institutions, such as Amazon, Newegg, PayPal, Authorize.net, or other companies. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process your order. We do not store your credit card number on our servers.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.</p>
    <h3 id="8_privacy_policies_of_third_party_sites">8. Privacy Policies of Third Party Sites</h3>
    <p>Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other sites accessible through our site have their own privacy policies and data collection, use, and disclosure practices. Please consult each site’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. Additionally, other companies which place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.</p>
    <h3 id="9_servers_and_content_delivery_networks">9. Servers and Content Delivery Networks</h3>
    <p>A server is a computer which can store the files and data that comprise a website. When displaying a website, your browser requests to download the files and data from the server. When we use the phrase “Kjeldager Holding IVS servers” in this Privacy Policy, we do not necessarily mean servers that Kjeldager Holding IVS itself owns and maintains. Rather, Kjeldager Holding IVS may contract with a hosting company such as Rackspace to provide these servers. You understand that Kjeldager Holding IVS is not responsible for any act or omission by the third party hosting company which causes you damage, including the exposure of Personally Identifiable Information.<br>Also, Kjeldager Holding IVS may use a Content Delivery Network (“CDN”), which is a distribution of servers in multiple datacenters, to improve our site’s performance and speed. The CDN may be provided by a third party, such as Akamai or Rackspace CDN. You understand that Kjeldager Holding IVS is also not responsible for any act or omission by the maintainer of the CDN which causes you damage. Furthermore, you understand that the servers which host the files and data of our site may be located outside the United States, and will not use that fact as a basis to sue us in those jurisdictions.</p>
    <h3 id="10_miscellaneous_privacy_issues">10. Miscellaneous Privacy Issues</h3>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old to have our permission to use this site. Our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose Personally Identifiable Information about visitors that are under 13 years of age. If you are over 13 years old but under the age of majority of the jurisdiction in which you live or the jurisdiction in which you reside, you must obtain parental consent before using Kjeldager Holding IVS.</p>
    <p>You should also be aware that when Personally Identifiable Information is voluntarily disclosed (i.e. your name, email address, etc.) in discussion forums or other public areas on this site, that information, along with any information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and this Policy does not apply to such information. Any submissions to other public areas on this site are accepted with the understanding that they are accessible to all third parties. If you do not want your comments to be viewed by third parties, you are advised not to make any submissions.
